# MediMate
## What does it do?
The MediMate is a user-friendly solution to remembering upcoming medication. Put in a date and time, and never worry about taking your medication again! This also has the option for recurring weeks, so you don't have to worry about setting a reminder every week.

## How can I do this?
You will need:

* x1 Computer
* x1 Copy of Python
* x1 Audio Output

## Requirements to setup
For this project, we used a Raspberry Pi. A Raspberry Pi is an affordable solution, the board costing ~Â£50. Our Raspberry Pi is using Raspbian OS, so you will need to install packages for this program via the Linux terminal. You can do this by typing this specific command into your Linux terminal: ```sudo pip install pygame tkinter datetime threading ttkwidgets```. After this, open the main.py file and define the locations of the reminder sound. For our program, we used a distinguishable beeping sound, so it is not confused with other background sounds. You can choose music, a voice recording, a favourite song, or anything that you would desire. After this, your code is ready!
